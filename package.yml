  - trigger: "/luftnote"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you plan to add checked luggage with Lufthansa, it's cheaper to select the fare class that includes it, rather than add it as an extra.</p>
      <p>Google Flights takes you to a page on their website with the fare class already selected. To change it, click the itinerary, 'Modify', and choose your flights again. Read detailed instructions <a href="https://jacksflightclub.com/flight-quick-guides-page#lufthansa">here</a>.</p>

  - trigger: "/flex"
    replace: >
      <strong>Note:</strong> Airlines do tend to offer more flexibility for flight changes, so if you're at all worried about having to move your booking later down the line we recommend spending a little extra to book directly with the airline.

  - trigger: "/gfnote"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The price shown on the Google Flights calendar may slightly differ to the price we have listed. This is due to the calendar not yet updating to reflect a price change. <a href="https://jacksflightclub.com/flight-quick-guides-page#no-price-match">Click here</a> to learn more.</p>
      <p>However, once you have selected your dates and clicked through to book with either the airline or an OTA, the price should adjust to match what we listed.</p>

    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Once you've selected your itinerary on TAP's website, you'll see a discounted fare automatically applied via the airline's loyalty programme (Miles&amp;Go).</p>
      <p>If you aren't a member of the programme, click the toggle next to the price under where it says 'Use miles to pay for your trip' to see your total without the discount.

      <p><strong>Note</strong>: some airlines, like Viva Aerobus, will automatically select their more expensive upgrade bundle when you click through to their website. Unless we've mentioned it in the 'Bags and fees' section above, the bundle is not worth paying more—you're likely better off adding what you need separately.</p>

    replace: >
      <p>We recommend Google Flights to find these trips because it has an easy-to-use calendar tool to browse dates and fares. See an example itinerary by pressing the blue button below.</p>
      <p>Adjust the dates for each flight according to how long you'd like to stay in each city, and wait for the price to refresh. Keep adjusting the dates until you see the price listed above.</p>
      <p>An alternative way to search for a broader range of trips is by looking for one-way flights. Change &ldquo;Multi-city&rdquo; to &ldquo;One-way&rdquo; (you may want to keep separate tabs open to search for your departure and return trips), and look for each of the individual flights until you find dates that work for you.</p>
      <p>From there, re-enter your itinerary information in the &ldquo;Multi-City&rdquo; format, and click through to the last page of Google Flights to proceed to booking.</p>

  - trigger: "/copa"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: when you select your flights on Copa's website, you'll need the option to choose your fare class. It's always best to choose 'Economy Basic', unless you need to add a checked bag. Read our quick guide to selecting the right option <a href="https://jacksflightclub.com/flight-quick-guides-page#copa">here</a>.</p>

  - trigger: "/currency"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> some airlines tend to change currency once you're redirected from Google Flights. It's worth reading our <a href="https://jacksflightclub.com/flight-quick-guides-page#change-currency">quick guide on which currency to pay with</a> before you book these trips.</p>

  - trigger: "/jetblueonly"
    replace: >
      <p>Go to jetBlue's Best Fare Finder through the blue button below. At the top of the page, select &ldquo;Add return date&rdquo; and scroll down to a month listed in this tip on their calendar tool.</p>
      <p>Look out for an outbound and inbound flight at the fare price we have listed. When you find dates that work for you, just tap 'see flights' to start booking.</p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you plan on taking a checked bag anyway, the extra ~&pound;20 for the &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; cabin also comes with seat selection &amp; free changes/cancellations, which is a better value upgrade than most airlines offer.</p>

  - trigger: "/otaonly"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: These flights are only available via Online Travel Agencies, not with the airline. If you're not sure about booking with an OTA, <a href="https://jacksflightclub.com/travel-hub/is-it-safe-to-book-with-smaller-otas-on-momondo">our guide</a> should point you in the right direction. </p><p>It's also worth checking <a href="https://jacksflightclub.com/travel-hub/reviewing-the-most-popular-online-travel-agencies">our write-up</a> on the best and worst OTAs, to help you choose the right one.</p><p>If you'd rather book with the airline directly, it's probably worth waiting for another flight tip to this destination. </p>

  - trigger: "/westjet"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: These trips are booked with WestJet’s new <a href="https://www.westjet.com/en-ca/news/2024/westjet-introduces-ultrabasic-">UltraBasic fare</a>. Unlike in the past, a carry-on is <b>not</b> included, you’ll be last to board, and you’ll be automatically booked into a middle seat at the back of the plane. If you want any perk at all, we’d recommend booking a higher tier of ticket.</p>

  - trigger: "/bagnote"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Despite some OTAs stating that the fare does not include a checked bag, the airline does include a checked bag. Based on this, we would strongly assume that a checked bag is also included in all OTA fares, along with a full-size cabin bag.</p>
      <p>If you want to guarantee that a checked bag is included, you can book with an OTA who explicitly states that one is included or directly with the airline.</p>

  - trigger: "/premeco"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: For most trips labelled as ‘Premium Economy’, you will only be flying in the Premium Economy cabin on the longest leg of your trip. The shorter legs will likely be in Economy, but you will have the added bonus of the higher baggage allowance across every leg of your trip. Always double-check the details of each leg of your trip before you book.</p>

  - trigger: "/aerlong"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: While Aer Lingus has tighter carry-on/cabin bag restrictions on flights within Europe, on long-haul flights to/from <strong>North America</strong>, each passenger is allowed to take a 10kg bag into the cabin with them, free of charge.</p>

  - trigger: "/aershort"
    replace: >
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: On short-haul Aer Lingus flights within Europe, each passenger is allowed to take a 10kg bag with them. It is free of charge to have the bag checked in once you arrive at the airport, or you can pay a small fee when booking your flights to take it into the cabin.</p>
      <p>This <strong>must</strong> be added on while you're making the booking. If you don't, and turn up to the boarding gate with the bag, you may be charged an additional fee. There is also a possibility that it is sold out at the time of making your booking, in that case the bag will have to be checked in.</p>
      <p>[<strong>&iexcl;</strong><em><strong>optional depending on your routes, eg. Dublin to the Isle of Man or Aberdeen!</strong></em>] On short-haul <strong>regional</strong> flights, each passenger is allowed to take a 7kg bag into the cabin with them, free of charge.</p>
